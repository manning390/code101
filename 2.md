## Operators
---
### Operators
> Programming languages typically support a set of operators: constructs which behave generally like functions but which differ syntactically or semantically from usual functions.
> Common simple examples include arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations
---
### Operators
> Most barebone functions, used frequently thus syntatically and semantically different
---
### Opertaors
```py
# Arithmetic
5 + 3 # Plus
# 8
5 - 3 # Minus
# 2
5 * 3 # Multiplication
# 15
```
---
### Opertaors
```py
5 // 3 # Integer divison
# 1
5 / 3 # Divison
# 1.6666666666666667
5 % 3 # Modulo
# 2
```
---
### Operators
```py
# Assignment
dog = 5
# Assign + Plus
dog *= 3
# dog = 15
```
```c
dog++; // Not in python!!!
// dog = 16
```

## Variables
---
### Variables
> A data item that may take on more than one value during the runtime of a program
> State, named data
---
### Variables
```py
dog = "uwu"
cat = 16
score = [4, 5, 2, 6]
dog = cat
# dog = 16
```

## Conditions
---
### Conditions
> Conditional statements, expressions, and constructs perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false
> aka logic
---
### Conditions
> Conditional statements, expressions, and constructs perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false
> aka logic
### Booleans
> A binary variable, having two possible values called 'true' and 'false'
> True or False
---
class: middle, center, inverse
## Loops
---
### Loops
> a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached
---
### Loops
Syntax and style change depending on your language

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // Repeat 10 times
}
```
---
### Loops
```py
for i in range(0, 10): # For loops
  print("hello " + i)

n = 0
while n < 20: # While loops, tend to be used for infinite loops
 n += 1

while True:
  if x == 5:
    break

 fruits = ['Apple', 'Tomato', 'Banana']
 for fruit in fruits: # Can be refered to as foreach or each loops
  print(fruit + ' can be found in the produce isle')
```

## Functions
---
### Functions
> A named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine.
> Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value
> Also known as a method, when it is a member to a class

### Algorithm
> A set of instructions, typically to solve a problem or perform a computation.
> A series of steps in order to do something.

## Your second program!
We're going to make tic-tac-toe
```sh
cd ~/code
mkdir projects
cd projects
mkdir tic
cd tic
subl tic.py
```
